      "content": "A group that contains fewer than four players might find combat encounters difficult, especially if the party lacks important capabilities (such as armored characters to stand toe-to-toe with enemies or healing magic to keep everyone alive). You can compensate by reducing the number of monsters in a combat encounter or by giving the party resources they need, such as *Potions of Healing*.\n\nYou can also add party members, as described in the sections that follow.\n\n#### DM-Controlled Adventurer\n\nYou can make an adventurer character of your own (sometimes called a \"DM PC\"—a \"Dungeon Master player character\") to accompany the party. This is a rewarding way for you to roleplay with your friends while they're exploring your world, but keep in mind that you'll have to run this NPC in combat.\n\nBe sure to keep the players' characters in the spotlight, and don't take away the players' agency by having your character make decisions for the group.\n\n#### NPC Party Members\n\nYou can add nonplayer characters (NPCs) to the adventuring party. Use the NPC stat blocks in the *Monster Manual* to represent these supporting characters. If you don't want to run these NPCs yourself, invite one or more of your players to take on an NPC as a secondary character. These NPCs might be apprentices or employees of the adventurers, so it's natural for the main characters to take the lead in exploration and social interactions while the NPCs fade into the background.\n\nSee \"*Nonplayer Characters*\" in *chapter 3* for more information.\n\n#### Players with Multiple Characters\n\nOne or more of your players can each play two characters. Running two characters at once is a challenge, so make sure those players are comfortable taking on multiple characters.\n\nThis approach works best in a game that's focused on combat, since it fills out a party with combat-capable characters. It can be difficult for a player to roleplay two characters at once. You might suggest that the player focus on roleplaying one character while relegating the other character to a supporting role.",

      "content": "The biggest considerations with large groups are maintaining order at the table and keeping combat from becoming too slow.\n\n#### Structured Turns\n\nIf you find yourself in a situation where individual players are having trouble getting a chance to do things during exploration or social interaction, have the characters roll Initiative and act in Initiative order, just as you do in combat. Taking turns ensures that everyone has the chance to do something. Use this approach sparingly, as it can feel artificial and sometimes slows down the game.\n\n#### Party Leader\n\nConsider having the players designate a party leader, who is then the only person who tells you what the group is doing. It becomes the leader's role to work with the rest of the players to find consensus on what the group will do.\n\n#### Speeding Combat\n\nPlayers who have to wait a long time between their characters' turns in combat are susceptible to distraction. Consider these tips to speed combat with a large group.\n\n***Be Generous with Information.*** If you tell the players what the Armor Class of their opponents is, you reduce the steps of interaction needed to resolve an attack. Instead of telling you a number and asking if it hits, a player can simply tell you that an attack hits and how much damage it deals, perhaps adding some narration for good measure (see \"*Narration in Combat*\" later in this chapter). In the same way, if you know each character's AC, you don't need to ask whether a monster's attack hits.\n\n***Help Players Keep Up.*** If a player isn't sure what to do on their turn in combat, help the player decide by offering a quick recap of the state of the battle. How many foes are still standing, and how hurt do they look? What's the most immediate threat to that character?\n\n***Make Initiative Obvious.*** Display the Initiative order to your players so they each know when their character's turn is coming up and can think ahead about what their character will do on their next turn. Using Initiative scores (see \"*Running Combat*\" in this chapter)—and perhaps seating the players in Initiative order—can be helpful with a large group.\n\n***Roll Handfuls of Dice.*** Encourage players to roll the dice for their attack rolls and their damage at the same time. You can do the same.",

      "content": "You decide when a player makes a D20 Test based on what the character is trying to do. Players shouldn't just roll ability checks without context; they should tell you what their characters are trying to achieve, and make ability checks only if you ask them to.\n\nWhen a situation comes up and you're not sure how to adjudicate it using the rules, use these four questions to help you decide:\n\n- **Is a D20 Test Warranted?** If the task is trivial or impossible, don't bother with a D20 Test. A character can move across an empty room or drink from a flask without making a Dexterity check, whereas no lucky die roll will allow a character with an ordinary bow to hit the moon with an arrow. Call for a D20 Test only if there's a chance of both success and failure and if there are meaningful consequences for failure.\n- **What Kind of D20 Test?** If a character is actively trying to do something, use an ability check (or an attack roll if the character is trying to hit something). If the character is reactively trying to avoid or resist something, use a saving throw.\n- **Which Ability Does the Test Use?** Think about which ability has the most influence on a character's chance to succeed on the ability check or saving throw. Refer to the Abilities, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws table for guidance. Also consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply to an ability check.\n- **What's the DC?** Based on how hard you think the task should be, set the DC as follows: 10 for an easy task, 15 for a moderately difficult task, or 20 for a hard task.",

      "section_title": "Ability Checks",
      "content": "An ability check is a test to see whether a character succeeds at a task the character has decided to attempt. The Abilities, Ability Checks, and Saving Throws table summarizes what each ability is used for. (Constitution checks are rare, as tests of a character's endurance are usually passive or reactive, making a saving throw more appropriate.)\n\n#### Proficiency\n\nWhen the rules or a published adventure calls for an ability check, a skill or tool proficiency is often called out: for example, \"a character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can puzzle out the magic involved.\" Sometimes the rules allow for any one of two or more proficiencies to apply to a check. When deciding what check a character should make, be generous in determining if the character's Proficiency Bonus comes into play. You might specifically ask for an Intelligence (Arcana) check, or you can ask for an Intelligence check and let the player negotiate with you to see if one of the character's skill or tool proficiencies applies.\n\n#### Trying Again\n\nSometimes a character fails an ability check and the player wants to try again. In many cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to attempt the same thing again. For some tasks, however, the only consequence of failure is the time it takes to attempt the task again. For example, failing a Dexterity check to pick a lock on a treasure chest doesn't mean the character can't try again, but each attempt might take a minute.\n\nIf failure has no consequences and a character can try and try again, you can skip the ability check and just tell the player how long the task takes. Alternatively, you can call for a single ability check and use the result to determine how long it takes for the character to complete the task.\n\n#### Group Checks\n\nGroup checks are a tool you can use when the party is trying to accomplish something together and the most skilled characters can cover for characters who are less adept at the task. To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\n\nGroup checks aren't appropriate when one character's failure would spell disaster for the whole party, such as if the characters are creeping across a castle courtyard while trying not to alert the guards. In that case, one noisy character will draw the guards' attention, and there's not much that stealthier characters can do about it, so relying on individual checks makes more sense. Similarly, don't use a group check when a single successful check is sufficient, as is the case when finding a hidden compartment with a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\n#### Passive Checks\n\nAbility checks normally represent a character's active effort to accomplish something, but occasionally you need a passive measure of how good a character is at doing a thing. Passive Perception is the most common example. (See \"*Perception*\" later in this chapter.) You can extend the concept of a passive ability check to other abilities and skills.",

Unless circumstances are unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without making a check.\n- **Easy, Moderate, and Hard.** These are the most common difficulties, and you can run your game using only them. A character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 percent of the time. For a moderate task, a character needs either a higher score or proficiency to have a similar chance of success, whereas a hard task typically requires both to have a similar chance.\n- **Very Hard and Nearly Impossible.** A DC 25 task is almost out of reach for low-level characters, but more reasonable after level 10 or so. Low-level characters have no chance to accomplish a DC 30 task, while a level 20 character with proficiency and a relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty.\n\nIf you're setting the DC for a saving throw, don't go lower than 10 or higher than 20. If a creature is the source of the effect forcing a saving throw, use the standard formula for calculating a save DC (see \"*Calculated DCs*\" below).\n\n#### Calculated DCs\n\nFor some ability checks and most saving throws, the rules default to the following formula:\n\n**DC** = 8 + ability modifier + Proficiency Bonus\n\nThis formula often sets the saving throw DC when a creature is casting a spell or using a special ability, but it can also apply to ability checks that are contests between two creatures. For example, if one creature is holding a door shut, use its Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus to set the DC for opening the door. When another creature tries to force the door open, the creature makes a Strength (Athletics) check against that DC.",

For example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means the trap wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt.\n\n#### Degrees of Success\n\nA successful D20 Test can have degrees of success. For example, when characters participate in an archery contest, you might decide that the more an attack roll exceeds the target's AC, the higher the character's score.\n\n#### Critical Success or Failure\n\nRolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw doesn't normally have any special effect. However, you can take such an exceptional roll into account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you to determine how this manifests in the game. One approach is to increase the impact of the success or failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt to pick a lock might jam the lock, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check might reveal an extra clue.\n\nFor attack rolls, the rules cover what happens on a natural 20 (it's a Critical Hit) or a natural 1 (it always misses).

For example, if a conversation with an NPC is cut short because the Sorcerer is convinced that NPC is a doppelganger and targets it with a *Chromatic Orb* spell, everyone rolls Initiative, and the Sorcerer does so with Advantage. If the doppelganger rolls well, it might still act before the Sorcerer's spell goes off, reflecting the monster's ability to anticipate the spell.\n\n#### Using Initiative Scores\n\nYou can get to the action of combat more quickly by using Initiative scores instead of rolling. You might decide to use Initiative scores just for characters, just for monsters, or for both.\n\n***Initiative Scores for Characters.*** A character's Initiative score is typically 10 plus all modifiers to the character's Initiative roll (including their Dexterity modifier and any special modifiers).\n\n***Initiative Scores for Monsters.*** A monster's stat block in the *Monster Manual* includes its Initiative score after its Initiative bonus.\n\n***Advantage and Disadvantage.*** If a creature has Advantage on Initiative rolls, increase its Initiative score by 5. If it has Disadvantage on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.",

If you aren't using miniatures or other visual aids, one way to track your monsters is to assign them unique features. For example, imagine that you're running an encounter with three ogres. You might attach descriptions such as \"the ogre with a big scar\" and \"the ogre with the helmet\" to help you and your players track which monster is which. Once Initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre's Hit Points and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one:\n\n**Krag (ogre w/ scar):** 68\n\n**Thod (ogre w/ helm):** 71\n\n**Mur (ogre smeared w/ dirt):** 59\n\nIf you use miniatures to represent monsters, one way to differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature.

For example, a character might move 1 square diagonally (5 feet), then 3 squares straight (15 feet), and then another square diagonally (10 feet) for a total movement of 30 feet.",

As the characters advance, increase their numbers; as the monsters advance toward the characters, decrease their numbers.\n- **Adjust the Grid Scale.** If you're using a battle grid, take a section of that grid and use it to track position, changing the scale so that each square is 30 feet. You don't need to be precise about creatures' positions, just their distance from each other.\n- **Dice as Range Counters.** Do away with the grid and put miniatures in their relative positions, using dice next to each miniature to show how far they've traveled. You can use percentile dice (or three d10s, with each die representing a digit in a three-digit number, if the encounter begins at a range between 100 and 1,000 feet), or use one or more d20s to show how many 5-foot or 10-foot squares the creature has advanced.",

      "content": "Although it's important that the players understand what's going on in terms of the rules, the game can get dull if everyone uses only \"gamespeak\": \"That's an 18 to hit,\" \"You hit; now roll damage,\" \"11 points,\" and \"OK, now we're to Initiative count 13.\" Instead, use the rules and your knowledge of the scene to help your narration. If 18 is barely a hit, but the 11 points of damage is a bad wound for the enemy, say: \"You swing wildly, and the knight brings his shield up just a second too late. Your blade catches him along the jaw, drawing a deep gash. He recoils, bleeding badly!\"\n\nAs the characters fight monsters, you can reveal information to help the players make good choices, as described in the sections that follow.\n\n> ##### Awarding Heroic Inspiration\n> As discussed in the *Player's Handbook*, Heroic Inspiration is a reward you can give to characters when their players make the game more fun, exciting, and memorable for everyone at the table. Any player who makes the whole table erupt in laughter, cheers, or howls of surprise probably deserves Heroic Inspiration.\n\n#### Loss of Hit Points\n\nYou can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature is Bloodied, you might say the creature has visible wounds and appears beaten down.\n\n#### Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses\n\nShare information with the players about the characteristics of creatures they fight as those characteristics become apparent. For example, if a Wizard casts *Fire Bolt* against a **Fire Elemental** (a creature that has Immunity to Fire damage), let the players know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all.\n\n#### Actions in Combat\n\nWhen a monster takes an action in combat, the players need to have some idea what's going on both in the fictional reality of the game and in terms of the rules of the game. This means that when an enemy with a Crossbow takes the Ready action to cover the area in front of a door, the players should have a pretty good idea that if their characters move in front of that door, the enemy will shoot them. \n\n##### Describing Actions\n| Action    | Description                                                             |\n|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dash      | \"Dispensing with attacks, your foe hurries across the room.\"            |\n| Disengage | \"Careful not to drop its guard, your foe edges away from you.\"          |\n| Dodge     | \"Your foe watches you closely and tries to parry your attacks.\"         |\n| Help      | \"While its ally attacks, your foe darts around, causing a distraction.\" |\n| Magic     | \"Your foe gestures in a deliberate manner and utters an invocation.\"    |\n| Ready     | \"Your foe seems to be waiting for something, ready to act.\"             |\n\n#### Monsters Casting Spells\n\nWhen a monster casts a spell, check the components it's using and describe its activity appropriately. If the spell has Verbal components, the monster might chant, boldly proclaim, or hiss the mystic syllables of the spell. Somatic components involve the monster moving its hands (or similar appendages) in graceful patterns, shaping them into angular positions, or thrusting them sharply forward. Finally, the monster might be holding a Spellcasting Focus or some other Material component.\n\nSome monsters have the special ability to ignore some or all of a spell's normal components, which might prevent characters from recognizing what the monster is doing. Similarly, when monsters use magical abilities that don't involve casting spells, make sure it's clear to the players that the monster is drawing on its unique magical abilities, not casting a spell their characters could counter.",

When that happens, here are a few techniques you can use to get things moving again or bring the encounter to a speedy close.\n\n#### Don't Repeat Game States\n\nWhen characters do something to change the tactical situation, don't respond by putting things back to the way they were before.\n\n#### Hasten a Monster's Demise\n\nIf a combat has gone on long enough and the characters' victory is almost certain, you can simply have the monster drop dead. The players don't ever need to know that it still had 15 Hit Points left after the characters' last attack.\n\n#### End Hostilities\n\nMost monsters can see when a fight's not going their way (or not going anywhere at all). A sapient monster might parley with the characters in an effort to get out of the situation alive.\n\n#### Add a Combatant\n\nTo add excitement to a battle, consider adding a combatant. Maybe a monstrous predator wanders onto the scene where the characters are locked in battle with another foe. Or maybe the noise of the ongoing combat attracts the attention of nearby dungeon denizens.\n\n#### Change the Terrain\n\nConsider changing a battle's terrain to introduce a new element and give combatants reasons to move around. Perhaps a powerful attack or an explosive spell topples a column, shatters a wall, or breaks up the floor.\n\n#### Change the Monster\n\nYou can transform one monster into another to keep a fight interesting. Maybe a **worg** splits open, and a **gibbering mouther** spills out to take its place.",

Sapient creatures confronted by obviously more numerous or powerful opponents usually try to avoid battle. But brave, desperate, or devoted creatures might never retreat from a battle.\n\nIf you can't decide whether a creature is willing to fight, have it make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw before Initiative is rolled. You can set the DC higher or lower if you like. On a failed save, the creature either flees or tries to parley with the enemy (see \"*Avoiding or Ending a Fight*\" below). On a successful save, the creature is willing to fight.\n\nWhen creatures that are already engaged in battle realize they're likely to lose, they usually try to exit that battle. A monster is likely to flee if either of the following is true:\n\n- The monster starts its turn Bloodied and more than half its allies are dead or have the Incapacitated condition, while no one is dead or Incapacitated on the other side.\n- The monster starts its turn Bloodied and has the Frightened condition.\n\nIn those circumstances, you can decide the monster flees, or you can have it make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw and flee or parley on a failed save. In general, if it is obvious to you that a creature is going to lose, assume it's obvious to that creature as well.\n\n#### Avoiding or Ending a Fight\n\nA creature that wishes to end or avoid a fight has two options:\n\n- **Flight.** The creature can retreat or run away on its turn. Select a destination for the fleeing party, such as a known place of safety (perhaps a room with a door that can be closed and barred).\n- **Parley.** A parley is an attempt to settle a conflict nonviolently. The side that wishes to end or avoid combat offers to surrender or proposes some sort of exchange. If one side wants to parley in the middle of combat and the other side agrees, you can suspend the Initiative order for some interaction.",
